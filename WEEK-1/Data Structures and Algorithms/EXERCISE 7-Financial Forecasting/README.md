## 1. Understanding Recursive Algorithms

Recursion is a programming technique where a method calls itself repeatedly until a base condition is met. It helps in simplifying problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar sub-problems.

In this exercise, recursion is used to calculate the future value of an investment by applying a fixed growth rate each year.

## 2. Setup

A method `forecastValue()` was created which takes:
- The **current value**
- The **growth rate**
- The **number of years**

It recursively multiplies the current value by the growth factor each year until it reaches year 0.
